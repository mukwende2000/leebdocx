# Welcome to leebcode 
This repository is my first ever real world web project
It is a personal blog site where the owner posts and blogs
about web development with helpful articles

I am keeping it public for open criticism, i know there are people out there
ready to help out, so feel free to give feedback on how i can improve and i will
massively appreciate.

I will make the link available as soon as i am done with deployment.
